ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ojhankit

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ML, particularly in the fields of natural language processing and computer vision.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently diving into ML libraries like PyTorch to strengthen my skills and understanding.

ðŸ’¼ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to ML, especially those focusing on innovative applications or solving real-world problems.

ðŸ“§ Feel free to reach out to me via email at ojha27ankit@gmail.com if you're interested in collaborating or discussing ML projects!
